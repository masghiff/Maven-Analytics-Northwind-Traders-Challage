The dashboard I have created is a data visualization platform that allows users to monitor and analyze the overall sales performance of the company. This dashboard is designed to provide deep insights into sales trends, product performance, key customers, and shipping metrics.

The Sales Trend Line graph enables users to see the sales development over time. The presented trend line provides a clear overview of sales growth or decline during specific periods. This helps identify sales trends and patterns, as well as make decisions based on historical information.

Geographical Maps Customers visualize the distribution of customers across regions. This interactive map allows users to view the geographic distribution of customers and identify areas that may have a larger market share potential. With a better understanding of customer locations, marketing and sales strategies can be more focused and effective.

The Discount Amount section presents information about the amount of discounts given in each transaction. The provided graphs and tables offer a clear picture of how often and how much discounts are applied. This helps measure the effectiveness of the company's discount strategies and gain insights into their impact on sales.

Product Performance provides detailed information about product categories, the quantity of products sold, and the revenue generated from each product. This allows users to evaluate the performance of individual products and identify those that contribute the most to the company's revenue. With a better understanding of product performance, strategic decisions such as resource allocation and product development can be made more effectively.

Key Customers presents a list of top customers based on total sales and total orders placed by customers. Additionally, information about customer locations (country and city) and the average discount given to customers is provided. This helps the company identify customers who have a significant impact on sales, understand customer preferences, and build strong relationships with them.

Shipping Cost provides information on shipping metrics such as average daily shipping time, shipping costs, and on-time delivery rates by shipping company. This helps the company evaluate shipping efficiency, identify areas for improvement, and manage shipping costs effectively.

The dashboard is designed with an intuitive interface, allowing users to easily explore the data and gain relevant insights. With rich and informative visualizations, this dashboard enables users to make data-driven decisions and improve the company's sales performance.

Thank you.
